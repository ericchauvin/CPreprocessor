# CodeAnalysisJava
This project is to analyze C and C++ source code.  One of the big problems in C and C++ is macros and things in the preprocessor.  So the first part of this project is to do preprocessing and to analyze what happens in the preprocessing phase.

One of the things programmers have learned over the years is to make functions testable.  You can't write a test function for every function (that would be very recursive!) but you can ask yourself how you would test a function.  You don't write a giant function with switch-case statements and even goto statements that is so complicated that you can't even think of a test for the function.  A function has to be conceptually straightforward and simple and understandable and testable.
